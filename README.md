## About

A tutored project for our 3rd year in bachelor of technologie. We develop a capture the flag game before making AI's that play that game.

## Features

This list is subject to change and new features will be added as the projet goes on </br>

ITERATION [2/7]

* Start a capture the flag game : select a map to play on, and edit the simulation (agent speed, how many players, respawn time...)
* Watch a game : while looking at a game, you can change the simulation speed, look at some statistics about the game and enter debug mode
* Replay a game : games can be saved and played again, thanks to random seeds
* Select your ai : we currently have 2 ai to choose from (random or behaviour tree)
* Open design : we designed the program to accept new in-game objects, new AI's, new ways for the AIs to see the world, new ways to visualize the simulation
